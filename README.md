## Problem Statement

We are to answer questions that involve earthquake behavior in the Northeast Pacific

9) Plot (scatter plot) earthquake magnitude vs time. 

10) Show earthquake locations (lat and lon) on a map by circles. The radius of these circles should be proportional to the earthquake magnitude.

11) Answer these questions: 

a. Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?

b. What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake size in this area? 

c. Map the earthquakes in April 2015. Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?

## Solution - Part 1

### 11) Questions
		
a) The map we were instructed to narrow in on is the region of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, and Pacific Northwest land region. This area is home to the Juan de Fuca plate. According the PNSN, "The Juan de Fuca Plate is still actively subducting beneath N. America." This subduction can cause lots of earthquakes in this region, as shown by Figure 2.

b) In the plotting time vs magnitude section, the average, minimum, maximum, and range values were determined for the data set. We must also remember that this data only includes earthquakes above 2.5 magnitude. The average magnitude for the set was 3.2, the minimum was 2.5, the maximum was 7.8, and the range was 5.3.

c) Below are the time vs magnitude graph and location of earthquakes in April 2015

Here we can see that there are a number of earthquakes occurring along the lower divergent boundary and along the transform boundary. The majority of earthquakes in this month happened on day 24, counting around 12 total. According to a write up found on AGU Journals, it was stated that the 24th of April was the beginning of an eruption of the Axial Seamount location. These explosive events lasted until May. After the initial explosion, water temperatures in the area rose and maintained constant for around a week. 

## Solution - Part 2

### Identifying locations of divergent and transform boundaries

Below are the areas of divergent and transform boundaries that I selected for my analysis:

d) Along the divergent plate boundaries we notice lower magnitude earthquakes. According to CUNY.edu this is because these divergent boundaries have more shallow siesmic activity. In an image on the site it is observed that only the lithosphere and crust move away from each other, while the asthenosphere remains dormant beneath. Less land mass moving would mean less energy released, resulting in less powerful earthquakes. Along the transform plate boundaries we notice higher magnitude and frequency of earthquake. According to the same source, it states that these boundaries are also shallow but involve very powerful earthquake responses. This may be due to the rubbing of landmass together, causing a higher amount of energy to be stored and released at a given time.
