## Problem Statement

We are to answer questions that involve earthquake behavior in the Northeast Pacific

9) Plot (scatter plot) earthquake magnitude vs time. 

10) Show earthquake locations (lat and lon) on a map by circles. The radius of these circles should be proportional to the earthquake magnitude.

11) Answer these questions: 

a. Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?

b. What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake size in this area? 

c. Map the earthquakes in April 2015. Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?

	
## Solution

### 11) Questions
		
a) The map we were instructed to narrow in on is the region of the Northeast Pacific Ocean, and Pacific Northwest land region. This area is home to the Juan de Fuca plate. According the PNSN, "The Juan de Fuca Plate is still actively subducting beneath N. America." This subduction can cause lots of earthquakes in this region, as shown by Figure 2.

b) In the plotting time vs magnitude section, the average, minimum, maximum, and range values were determined for the data set. We must also remember that this data only includes earthquakes above 2.5 magnitude. The average magnitude for the set was 3.2, the minimum was 2.5, the maximum was 7.8, and the range was 5.3.

c)
