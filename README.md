## Problem Statement

We are to answer questions that involve earthquake behavior in the Northeast Pacific

9) Plot (scatter plot) earthquake magnitude vs time. 

10) Show earthquake locations (lat and lon) on a map by circles. The radius of these circles should be proportional to the earthquake magnitude.

11) Answer these questions: 

a. Across what geographic area are you able to observe earthquake data in this map? Why do you see most of the earthquakes in that area?

b. What is the range of earthquake size (magnitude) in these data? What is the average earthquake size in this area? 

c. Map the earthquakes in April 2015. Where are those earthquakes mostly located? What event can you link these earthquakes to?
